com.gw7mqe.uscada_p,Micro SCADA Pocket,"uSCADA(p) is primarily intended to link an intelligence device such as a microconrtoller or PLC to an Android Phone or Tablet, using the MODBUS protocol over Bluetooth. The idea was to give developers a system that could quickly provide projects with a usable interactive front end.This program is an extension to the uMODBUS(m) software and as a result shares some of its methodology and functionality.  The Bluetooth medium was selected as with this a direct device to device serial connection can be made that does not rely on any supporting networks, in this way the software can be used for the development of portable applications.  A project can be built up using the various sections of the software so that Digital and Analogue Inputs can be read back from the intelligent device and displayed in a readable form.Additionally by taking advantage of some of the capabilities of the Android system, digital inputs may be given alarm sounds by associating mp3 files and spoken responses to state changes. Theses associated sounds and phrases are configurable and do not have to be used.With uSCADA(p) the raw data provided by a remote ADC may be prepared and scaled to provide a meaningful analogue for display. Units can also be added and level alarms may be generated when threshold trigger points are reached. These functions are also configurable. Digital and Analogue Outputs options are also provided and allow user entry on the Android device to be prepared and written back to the Intelligent device.State changes may be logged and the condition of analogue inputs can be periodically archived to file.  The final output of the software is to provide 8 fully configurable display lines that can be set to perform any desired IO function.",

com.schmersal.psc1.configurator,PSC1 Configurator,"Convenient planning tool: The PSC1 ConfiguratorSchmersal&#39;s PSC1 Configurator is an online tool that is available 7 x 24 hours. It enables the machine manufacturer and machine user to configure a safe sequence control system easily and quickly to suit for the individual requirements of their plants. The PSC1 Configurator is self-explanatory, easy to use, and generates a comprehensive planning structure for design engineers in just a few minutes. It is available as a web version or can be used conveniently with tablets via the App.Based on a selection of safety sensors and outputs, the planning tool automatically combines the optimum (also pricewise) PSC1 Schmersal safety control system, and also indicates how much space is required by the respective configured module(s) on the top-hat rail. Simultaneously, the PSC1 Configurator generates a parts list with item description, material number, and equipment details. This parts list is linked to Schmersal&#39;s online catalog, so that additional information on the equipment can be called if necessary. The parts list can be saved as an Excel or PDF file, and sent to Schmersal directly via e-mail, who will then provide an offer specially tailored to the user&#39;s needs. In this way, the PSC1 Configurator ensures simple and fast order processing.Various field bus protocols availableThanks to its modular approach, the PSC1 sequence control system permits machine safety functions to be adapted the most varied applications. Core components of this sequence control system are freely programmable compact controllers (PSC1-C-10), whereby IO extension modules for safe signal processing of different safety switches are available. By means of a universal communications interface, the user can select different field bus protocols easily via software. Consequently, the same hardware can establish a communication link to all conventional field bus systems. The following field bus protocols are selectable in the PSC1 Configurator: PROFINET, PROFINET PROFIsafe, EtherCAT, EtherCAT FSOE, Profibus, Profibus ProfiSafe, and Ethernet IP.In addition, the universal communications interface of the PSC1 provides a serial diagnosis gateway for the connection of diagnostic signals from safety switching devices with integral SD interface. The SD gateway converts the serial diagnostic signal from the sensors and guard locks to suit the selected field bus protocol.Moreover, the user can install an optional SD memory card, with which the configured programs can be saved. For example, this eliminates the need for re-programming in case the hardware must be replaced.And finally, the PSC1 Configurator permits the safety system for an additional machine or a decentralized automation concept to be planned. By means of the &quot;Topology&quot; function, the configurator visualizes how the sequence control systems of both machines are connected.The PSC1 Configurator is available in the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Chinese.",

Please read the details below! ====This is the free-try version. You can tryout SolarMON with your PV system for 20 days after installation without any limitation. After that an information screen is shown every now and then. If you like SolarMON you can buy the PRO version which has no limitations. Features=======In contrast to the SolarEdge monitoring SolarMON connects directly via your local LAN to the Inverter and reads the real time data directly from it, totally cloud free! This gives you a couple of advantages:1)  No delay! The data is Real-Time. SolarMON supports updates down to every second, giving you exact inside what your Solar System is producing this very moment.2)  It works even when your Internet is down or you do not have internet connection available at your installation side.3)  No dependency on a cloud servers.

Die App bietet dem Bereitschaftsdienst eine zuverlässige, sichere und insbesondere bedienerfreundliche Lösung für die tägliche Arbeit in der Rufbereitschaft.Die Alarm APP signalisiert den Eingang eines neuen Alarms über einen Signalton, so dass kritische Alarme auch sicher wahrgenommen werden. Das Design der Alarm APP wurde bewusst puristisch gestaltet, da der Alarm selbst im Vordergrund steht und der Anwender sich nicht mit der Bedienung der APP beschäftigen muss. Die Bedienung der Alarm APP ist intuitiv und selbst erklärend. Die Alarm APP bietet jederzeit einen Überblick über den Status aller eingegangenen Alarme. Das Quittieren eines eingetroffenen Alarms erfolgt durch einfaches Antippen des Alarms. Durchgeführte Quittierungen können direkt über die Alarm APP betrachtet werden.Neben der Kernfunktion der Fernalarmierung kritischer Störungen bietet die Alarm APP auch eine Funktion zum direkten Versenden von Nachrichten aus dem SCADA-System an. So können Sie den Bereitschaftsdienst über eine direkte Nachricht informieren, dass zum Beispiel bei der Überprüfung einer Anlage noch der Zustand der Pumpe zu prüfen ist.In Abhängigkeit von der eingesetzten Geräteplattform kann über eine Einstellung in der Alarm APP der Lautlos-Modus des Smartphones überschrieben werden. Mit Hilfe dieser Einstellung wird beim Eintreffen eines neuen Alarms immer ein Signalton ausgegeben – auch wenn das Smartphone auf lautlos gestellt ist.Die Alarm APP steht für die Prozessleitsysteme SCADA.web und für SCADA V10 ab der Version 10.6 zur Verfügung.",
